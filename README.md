# Ramp Simulator

An interface for _simulating_ specific sequences of spells, the aim is to provide an easy way to
consider various complex spell combinations that are otherwise very arduous to plot and calculate.
With the Ramp Simulator you can consider similar spell sequences with different talents, trinkets,
or other variations more easily.

## Installation

- Clone the repository
- Run `yarn` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn start` to start the interface

## Running Tests

Currently the library doesn't have a huge amount of coverage, however if you wish to run the test
suit it's as easy as running `yarn run test`.
